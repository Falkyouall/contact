description: From idea to working prototype in days, not months. Fast validation of concepts with production-grade code.
---

Turn your idea into a functional prototype quickly so you can validate it with real users before committing to a full build.

## What I offer

- Interactive prototypes built with production-ready technologies
- Fast iteration cycles to test assumptions early
- CMS-backed content prototypes for editorial and marketing teams
- Landing pages and product pages with real data integrations

## Track record

- Built accessible financial product landing pages in the banking sector using React, TypeScript, and container-based cloud deployments
- Delivered CMS-driven websites for multiple clients using headless content management systems like Strapi and DatoCMS
- Created document automation workflows for the financial services industry

## Why it works

Prototypes are built with the same tools and patterns used in production. This means validated ideas can evolve into full products without starting over. No throwaway code, no rewrites.

## Technologies

- React, TypeScript, Next.js, TanStack Start
- Strapi, DatoCMS, Netlify CMS
- Node.js, Docker

I help development teams adopt AI-powered tools and workflows so they can ship faster and work more effectively.

## What I offer

- Hands-on workshops introducing AI coding assistants into existing development workflows
- Setup and configuration of AI tools tailored to your team's stack and processes
- Establishing practical guidelines for when and how to use AI in day-to-day engineering work
- Evaluating which AI tools fit your team's needs and which ones don't

## Who this is for

- Engineering teams that want to start using AI tools but don't know where to begin
- Tech leads looking to establish AI usage guidelines for their teams
- Companies that have purchased AI tool licenses but see low adoption

## What you get

- A team that knows how to use AI tools effectively in their actual codebase
- Clear internal guidelines on AI-assisted development
- Reduced onboarding friction for new tools so adoption sticks

## Format

Sessions are practical and hands-on — working directly in your codebase, not slides. The goal is that your team is self-sufficient with AI tools by the end of the engagement.

contactHeading: "Need a fullstack TypeScript project?"

I build complete web applications in TypeScript across the entire stack — from interactive frontends to server-side APIs and cloud infrastructure.

## What I offer

- End-to-end TypeScript applications with shared types between frontend and backend
- Frontend architecture using React or Vue with state management (Redux, Pinia)
- Backend services with Node.js, NestJS, and API layers (REST, GraphQL, gRPC)
- Cloud deployment on GCP, AWS, or Azure with infrastructure as code (Pulumi, Terraform)
- Database design and integration with PostgreSQL and Firebase

## Industry experience

- **Financial services**: Accessible, WCAG-compliant product pages deployed on container-based cloud infrastructure
- **Automotive**: Vehicle configurator frontends using module federation and domain-driven architecture; fleet management tools processing vehicle data from mobile inputs
- **Logistics**: Complete web application for AI-supported route planning with test-driven development
- **Design tooling**: Custom Figma plugins with OAuth integration to streamline UI designer workflows
- **Content platforms**: Headless CMS solutions for editorial teams using Strapi and DatoCMS

## How I work

Clean, maintainable, and extensible code is the baseline. I follow test-driven development practices and set up CI/CD pipelines so that deployments are reliable from day one.

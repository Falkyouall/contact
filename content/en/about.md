# Hey, I'm Falk

I'm a frontend developer and tech lead based in Munich. I've been building web applications for over 11 years now, and I still genuinely enjoy it. I care about writing clean, maintainable code and creating things that actually work well for the people using them.

## What I do

I currently work as a JavaScript Tech Lead at Appsfactory, where I lead a small team of developers. My day to day involves a mix of hands on coding, architecture decisions, code reviews, mentoring, and shaping how we hire. I've worked on projects across different industries, from financial platforms and automotive configurators to internal tooling and custom Figma plugins.

Some highlights from recent years:

- Built an accessible, WCAG compliant financial product page for Targobank using React, TypeScript, and Azure Container Apps
- Led the technical pitch and frontend architecture for the Škoda vehicle configurator, using module federation and domain driven development
- Developed a vehicle inventory management interface for VW, processing VINs extracted from photos and displaying their stati in a Vue.js web view
- Created 5 custom Figma plugins for Daimler that improved UI designer workflows with OAuth integration

Before that, I was Lead Engineer at Smartlane, where I built a complete logistics planning web app in TypeScript and React with Redux and test driven development. On the side, I've been freelancing since 2016, mostly building CMS websites with Next.js, Strapi, and Netlify CMS.

## Tech I work with

On the frontend I mainly use React, Vue, and TypeScript. On the backend it's Node.js, Next.js, and NestJS. I'm comfortable with cloud platforms like GCP, AWS, and Azure, and I use Pulumi and Terraform for infrastructure. For databases I typically reach for PostgreSQL or Firebase. I work with GraphQL, REST, and gRPC depending on the project.

## Education

I studied Media Informatics at LMU Munich (B.A., 2014 to 2017) and Media Management at Media Design Highschool Munich (B.A., 2009 to 2013).

## Outside of work

When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me bouldering. I've been climbing for over 16 years and it's my favourite way to clear my head. I also love cooking and I'm currently learning Spanish.
